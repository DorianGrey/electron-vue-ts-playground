Nothing special for now, just for testing purposes.

# Technologies involved:
- [electron-webpack](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-webpack)
- [vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)


# Tasks
- `start`: Dev. mode.
- `build`: Creates production builds, currently for windows and linux.

# Warning
- `build` does not yet yield useful results, esp. the navigation does not work. Still investigating.
